## How it all started?

Over my 15 year design career, I've spent countless hours manually inspecting websites with DevTools and related customer tools: 1-3 hours per brand plus the additional sites to benchmark, and sometimes there is no one from the customer to toss around these ideas of meaningful digital experiences.

Designers have been and will still struggle to dissect brands from websites, and it’s not just about extracting colors: that’s the easy part. The real challenge is understanding what truly matters in a brand system. Developers also feel the pain when designs lack proper color values etc.

Dembrandt is my attempt to help designer-dev-business-customer workflow. Dembrandt is not by no means perfect, but it works enough. It saves me hours every week — and maybe it can do the same for you. Just dissect the brand with 1 command and use the design tokens in your preferred design systems.
