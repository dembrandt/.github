## How it all started

Over my 15 year design career, I've spent countless hours manually inspecting websites with DevTools: 1-3 hours per brand plus additional sites to benchmark.

Designers struggle to dissect brands from websites—it's not just about extracting colors (that's the easy part). The real challenge is understanding what truly matters in a brand system. Developers also feel the pain when designs lack proper color values.

Dembrandt saves me hours every week. Just dissect the brand with 1 command and use the design tokens in your preferred design systems.
