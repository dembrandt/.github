### *_Removing hesitation of what customer wants for design._*

---

## What

Tools to bridge the gap between designers, developers, and business needs.

**[Dembrandt](https://github.com/dembrandt/dembrandt)** - Extract any website's design system into design tokens in seconds: logo, colors, typography, borders, and more. One command.

```bash
npx dembrandt bmw.de
```

**Other repos** - Wait for it.

---

## Why

Missing brand guides and design documentation create friction. Designers spend 1-3 hours manually inspecting sites with DevTools. Developers struggle when designs lack proper values. Business needs clash with unclear customer expectations.

We're building tools that remove manual work and hesitation from the designer-developer-business workflow.

---

## How

Open source, automation-first approach. Our tools analyze live sites, extract real usage patterns, and output standardized tokens you can use in any design system.

**Get started:**
```bash
npm install -g dembrandt
dembrandt bmw.de
```

**Requires Node.js 18+**
